    Academy. We have completed our initial review of applications and would like to update you on the status.</p>

<h3 style="color: #1e40af;">What Does "Waitlisted" Mean?</h3>
<p>Being waitlisted means that {{ application.student_first_name }}'s application has been carefully reviewed and found
    to meet our admission standards. However, due to limited space in the {{ application.get_grade_applying_for_display
    }} class, we cannot offer immediate admission at this time.</p>

<p>{{ application.student_first_name }} is now on our priority waiting list, and we will contact you immediately if a
    space becomes available.</p>
